g8 or giter8 is templating software by n8han. 
see [github project](https://github.com/n8han/giter8).

I reccommend you install it via 
[Typesafe Stack](http://typesafe.com/stack/download) that also gives you sbt in the bundle.

Osx users can install it via brew:
    
    brew update
    brew install giter8
